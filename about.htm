	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! I'm Dan Yost, an aspiring game developer
	and designer. I created this website as a sort of portfolio for me. Its a
	central hub where you can	find download links for all my past and ongoing
	works, as well as links to	my various social media accounts. Feel free to
	have a peek around; let me know if you like anything!
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit about myself:
